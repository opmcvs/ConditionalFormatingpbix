# Conditional Formatting in Power BI

This README provides instructions for implementing conditional formatting in Power BI using the provided datasets.

## Datasets

Three datasets are provided:

1. **Product Data:**
   - Contains information about various products including Product ID, Product Name, Price, Production Cost, and Revenue.

2. **Sales Data:**
   - Contains details about customer purchases including Customer ID, Customer Name, Product ID, Order ID, Units Sold, and Date Purchased.

3. **Customer Data:**
   - Includes information about customers such as Customer ID, Customer Name, Address, City, State, and Zipcode.

## Conditional Formatting Setup

1. **Import Data:**
   - Import all three datasets into Power BI.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Establish relationships between datasets based on common fields (e.g., Customer ID, Product ID).


3. **Conditional Formatting:**
   
   - Define rules based on criteria. For example:
     - Format cells with revenue > $5000 in green.
     - Format cells with low profit margin in red.
     - Format cells with high sales volume in blue.
   - Adjust formatting options such as colors, icons, and data bars according to your preference.
